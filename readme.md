# Unreal 5 Digital Twin

This repository showcases work produced during my 8 months building the Digital Innovation Lab technology stack at RGU. Technical lead of a small team responsible for research and development of a large scale interactive digital twin of Aberdeen City sourcing from 90km<sup>2</sup> of point cloud derived meshes.

The model allows for realtime manipulation of the scene including flood modelling, weather modelling, time of day cycles, and seasonal changes. Powered by a geospatial Postgres database enabling layers of realworld data to be integrated into the model, allowing visualisation of millions of data points. These layers of data can form inputs for ML based discovery greatly expanding the business potential of the project.
